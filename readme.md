# Age of Wujin MUD

## MUDs

Multi-user dungeons (MUDs) originated in the 1970s, and were the first real-time multiplayer computer games. They are the ancestors of modern MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games).

## Introduction

You control a character, who can move around a world filled with monsters and loot. You can buy progressively-more-powerful equipment, gain permanent character strength ("levels"), learn diverse abilities, conquer entire zones, complete quests, etc.

When exploring the world, you can walk in cardinal directions or move to particular coordinates.

You can hunt for monsters, seek out quest objectives, talk to other players, gain loot, buy equipment, learn skills and spells, gain experience, etc. All the things you do in a normal role-playing game.

## How to Connect

Use a MUD client, such as `telnet`, `tintin++`, `ZMUD`, etc. Use the client to connect to the game's IP address and port.
